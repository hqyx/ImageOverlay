How to Package Image Overlay for macOS

1. Transfer the following files to your Mac:
   - main.py
   - requirements.txt

2. Open Terminal on your Mac and navigate to the folder containing these files.

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

4. Install the dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install pyinstaller

5. Build the application:
   pyinstaller --name "ImageOverlay" --windowed --onefile --noconsole --icon=icon.icns main.py

   (Note: You can create an icon.icns file if you want a custom icon, otherwise omit --icon)

6. The application will be in the "dist" folder as "ImageOverlay.app".

7. You can zip this .app file and send it to your users.

Note regarding Right-Click Menu on macOS:
Unlike Windows, macOS does not use the Registry for context menus. 
Users can simply right-click an image, select "Open With", and choose "Image Overlay". 
They can also set it as the default application for specific image types via "Get Info".
